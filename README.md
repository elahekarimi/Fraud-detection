## Project Description

This project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or regular. It includes the following steps:
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature selection.
- Model training: Building and training an XGBoost classifier.
- Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
- Visualization: Plotting performance metrics and distribution of features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes outlier detection and handling, missing value imputation.
- **Model Training**: XGBoost classifier for fraud detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC, and precision-recall curves.
- **Visualizations**: Boxplots, distribution plots, confusion matrix.
